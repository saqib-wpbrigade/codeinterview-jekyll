                            <p>
                                Prior to starting CodeInterview, we ran a mobile app development agency with 25+
                                engineers
                                and big-name clients like Toyota, ESPN and Next. We were constantly building teams
                                of
                                developers to meet project demands and quickly realized that technical recruitment
                                is very
                                hard and expensive.
                            </p>

                            <p> Finding out a candidate isn't a good fit late in the process or even hiring the
                                wrong person
                                was an ongoing cost that the industry accepted as something normal. However, we knew
                                there
                                has to be a better way to screen and evaluate candidates without wasting precious
                                hours that
                                could be spent building software.
                            </p>

                                So we came up with several tools for assessing technical skill and interviewing
                                developers
                                before spending too much time and energy on recruitment. This is how CodeInterview
                                came to
                                be.

                            <p>By scratching our own itch, we bumped into a real problem faced by thousands of
                                companies
                                worldwide, especially as more businesses switched to remote and hybrid work
                                arrangements.
